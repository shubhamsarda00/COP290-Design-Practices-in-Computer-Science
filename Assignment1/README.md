# Assignment 1
In task 1, we've implemented simple functions used in a neural network such as matrix addition, multiplication, pooling, activation and probability calculation to facilitate complete neural network architectures in upcoming tasks.

In task 2, we aim to improve the efficiency (runtime) of the matrix multiplication function we implemented in task 1. Weâ€™ve tried to do the same using: 

1) Libraries such as **mkl** and **OpenBLAS** 2) Multithreading using **pthreads**

In task 3, we aim to stitch together an audio processing library for identifying keywords in an audio 
sample using functions created in previous tasks.
