This repo contains assignments done during the course COP290 (Design Practices in Computer Science) in Semester II 21-22 (https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rijurekha/cop290_2022.html).

In Assignment 1, we developed an audio processing library to detect keywords in an audio file using Artificial Neural Networks.
